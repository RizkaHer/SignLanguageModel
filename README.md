# SignLanguageModel
This is the implementation of Mask-RCNN on sign language recognition, especially for BISINDO (Indonesian Sign Language). You can used this repository for training using Google Collaboratory. All the data needed are shared below. For the image data, you can make a shortcut inside the folder of the project from shared folder.

This repository includes:
- MRCNN from matterport 
- Train code for sign language model
- Notebook for inspecting the trained model.


# Getting Started
- Images for training can be downloaded/accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16CI9IvBjIH_nmmL_ZyQXugq_oDpB52Vi?usp=sharing). 
- Sign Language trained weight can be downloaded/accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15AyepiEwXs-VPYuTB7Ji2fKCKCE9v6_x/view?usp=sharing).
- Image for real testing can be downloaded/accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a5JDsWmY-70FHOLBHFEEYq4hV8p8HqIa?usp=sharing).
- The result preview after Sign Language training can be seen in the notebook Bisindo_Model.ipynb

# Installation
